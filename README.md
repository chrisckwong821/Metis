# ReadME


The project is our team-effort for Microsoft Hackathon 2017. It aims to incorporate Bot Framework and Azure Face API. For development, we also incorporated opencv to detect faces using pre-trained haar-cascade features.

You are welcome to contact Waqas Ali or me in case you find this is fun

python = 2.7.13
opencv seems not in the requirements, maybe because I built it from binary because of some GUI issues in Mac OS.
pip install opencv-python should be fine for Window.
